        <h2>My Travels</h2>
        <p>I have traveled to 3 continents, 6 countries, and 12 states. I haven't been to many places yet but I am mentally making travel plans all the time. My favorite country that I have traveled to so far is The Philippines. My husband and I spent three weeks there for our honeymoon.</p>

      <li>The second page can be whatever you like, though "About Me" is a nice default.</li>
      <li>Use dummy content wherever you like on these pages (feel free to use Lorem Ipsum https://lipsum.com/). The focus should be on writing clean, semantic HTML.</li>
      <li>As always, style matters. If you are including local images, they should be inside a directory called "images" within the main project directory.</li>
      <li>Remember to view your pages in different browsers before turning this in. If you've made HTML errors that reduce the functionality of the page, you'll lose points, and they're easy to catch by just viewing it in a browser! You should also remember to always validate your code: https://validator.w3.org/.</li>
      <li>Use git to commit as you go along. Create a GitHub repository called 'portfolio' and link it to your local repository. Push your work up to GitHub, and submit a link to the GitHub repo for the assignment. Refer to Lessons 00 and 01 if you need a refresher on git & GitHub.</li>

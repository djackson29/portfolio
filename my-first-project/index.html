        <h3>I Love to Travel <i class="fas fa-globe-americas"></i></h3>
        <p>I have traveled to 3 continents, 6 countries, and 12 states. I haven't been to many places yet but I am mentally making travel plans all the time.
        <p>My favorite country that I have traveled to so far is The Philippines. My husband and I spent three weeks exploring the islands for our honeymoon in Fall 2019. The whole trip was amazing but I really enjoyed the three days we spent on a small island named Siquijor. We rented mopeds and traveled around the quiet island at our own pace. We checked out multiple waterfalls and found one awesome lagoon with rope swings!</p>

        <h3>Summertime!</h3>
        <p>Camping trips, boating, and sunshine is my happy place. I am usually sleeping in a tent near a lake or the Columbia River almost every weekend in the summer. I also LOVE going to concerts at The Gorge.</p>
        <p>I grew up living on two different lakes, so for me, summer means spending as much time as possible near the water. While I was in college and working, I didn't have as much opportunity to enjoy the water and boating. So after we graduated college and both had full time positions, I convinced my husband we needed a boat. Now it is his favorite summertime activity as well!</p>
        <p>One of my summertime traditions is going to concerts at The Gorge. I have attended the country music festival, Watershed, every year since 2013. One summer I went to five different concerts at The Gorge.</p>
